        <strong>What I did:</strong> Along with my partner, our goal was to create a website that would introduce the user to the Black Affairs Council, an
        organization at Stevens Institute of Technology intended to represent the Black community and the Black-centered organizations on campus.

            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Inspiration</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">For our design, the biggest inspirations were the website for Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. and Howard
                University. The focus was on wide images that would take up the viewport along with text hierarchy, making sure the titles
                of each section was big and visible. <br>

        <h4 style="text-align: center;">What I learned</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">I learned how important the user is when designing a website. In a new 
        design, I would change the color scheme to be more accessible, increasing the contrast between the colors as the white 
        against the grey does not give enough contrast and accessibility is important to me in my designs. I would make the 
    site more responsive to different viewports as well. Lastly, the placement and sizing of the images would be neater and consistent.
Overall, the project was a great learning experience for documentation, designing, and working on a team.</p>
